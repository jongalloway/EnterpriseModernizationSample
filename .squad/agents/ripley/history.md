## Recent Updates

📌 Team initialized on 2026-05-13
📌 Decision consolidation on 2026-05-13T18:42:26Z: Scribe merged inbox decisions (3 entries) into canonical `decisions.md`. Orchestration log created for Ripley's scenario definition task. Repository structure decisions now locked in canonical ledger.

## Learnings

- The sample should feel like a business app that kept accumulating projects and integration seams over time.
- Cross-project consistency matters, but visible historical layering is intentional.
- Enterprize Pizza Franchise Platform is the selected baseline scenario because it supports believable legacy sprawl across desktop, web, service, and SQL Server boundaries.
- Repository framing now reserves `docs\before`, `docs\after`, `docs\foundation`, `src\before`, `src\after`, and `data\sqlserver` for legacy versus modernized work.
- Key files for this direction are `README.md`, `docs\foundation\enterprise-scenario.md`, and `.squad\decisions\inbox\ripley-enterprize-pizza-scenario.md`.
